# Workshop - Build and Deploy Spring Petclinic Application to Amazon ECS using Terraform and AWS CodePipeline 

### Introduction

This workshop is designed to enable Solutions Architects and engineers to get some hands-on experience using Terraform with AWS Continuous Ingration and Continuous Devlivery tools and services.  The workshop consists of a sequence of steps to build a pipeline for an Amazon ECS workload using the Java PetClinic sample application. The pipeline itself uses AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeCommit, AWS CodeBuild, Amazon ECS/Fargate and Amazon ECR.


### Background

The Spring PetClinic sample application is designed to show how the Spring application framework can be used to build simple, but powerful database-oriented applications. It uses AWS RDS (MySQL) at the backend and it will demonstrate the use of Spring's core functionality. The Spring Framework is a collection of small, well-focused, loosely coupled Java frameworks that can be used independently or collectively to build industrial strength applications of many different types.
